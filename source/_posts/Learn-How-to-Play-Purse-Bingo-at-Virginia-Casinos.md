#  Learn How to Play Purse Bingo at Virginia Casinos

Looking for a fun and exciting new way to gamble? Purse bingo may be just the game for you. This unique variant of bingo is played with a regular deck of playing cards, and the goal is to mark off as many purses on your card as possible.

The best way to learn how to play purse bingo is to head to a casino in Virginia and take part in a game or two. Casinos in the state offer purse bingo every day, so there’s always an opportunity to play. If you’d prefer to stay at home, you can also find online casinos that offer this game.

To begin, each player is dealt five cards. The dealer then sets out four face-up purses. The player who covers the most purses on their individual cards wins the hand. In case of a tie, the player with the highest value card wins. The first player to win three hands wins the overall game.

Purse bingo shares some similarities with blackjack. For example, players can hit, stand, double down, or split their cards as they would in blackjack. In addition, Aces are worth one or eleven points, and face cards are worth ten points each.

There are a few other things you should know about Purse bingo before you start playing:

- In order to win a hand, players must cover at least one purse with a card rank or higher than the rank of the purse. For example, if there’s an Ace displayed as one of the purses, then any card other than an Ace can be used to claim that purse.

- The Ace can also be used as a wild card and can be used to represent any other card in the deck. This comes in handy when trying to complete a particular pattern on your card.

- If all four of the face-up purses are claimed by other players, then the dealer turns over four more purses and place them upside down on the table. This process continues until all 52 cards have been turned over or until there are no more faces up purses left in which case the dealer wins that particular round.
