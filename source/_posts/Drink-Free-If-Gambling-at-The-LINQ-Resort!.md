#  Free Drinks If You're Gambling At The LINQ Resort!

Las Vegas is known for many things, its endless buffet of food, the shows on the strip, and of course its casinos. Casinos are a staple in any visit to Vegas, and they come in all shapes and sizes. There are the massive resorts like Wynn and Bellagio, complete with their own theme parks and attractions. Then there are the older places like Circus Circus and The Gold Coast which may not have as much to offer in terms of amenities, but make up for it with lower prices and plenty of gaming options.

One casino that falls somewhere in between these two extremes is The LINQ Resort. It's not as big as the luxurious resorts, but it's also not as small as some of the older places. It has a good selection of restaurants and shops, as well as all the traditional casino games you would expect. What really makes The LINQ stand out though is its free drinks policy.

As long as you're gambling at one of the tables or slot machines, you can order any drink you want from the bar without having to pay for it. This includes alcoholic beverages and non-alcoholic drinks too, so it's a great place to go if you're looking for some cheap refreshments while you play. Just be sure to keep an eye on your bankroll while you're enjoying those free drinks!
