#  Apple and Google block gambling apps in bid to end addiction

In a continued effort to end addiction, Apple and Google have announced that they will be banning all gambling apps from their app stores.

This move is in line with the companies’ previous efforts to remove addictive apps from their stores. In January, Apple announced that it would be removing all time-wasting apps from its store, and in March, Google announced that it would be banning all apps that encourage excessive use.

While gambling apps are not as widely used as other types of addictive apps, they can be just as dangerous. According to a study conducted by the University of British Columbia, gambling apps can be up to six times more addictive than other types of apps.

This move is likely to be welcomed by many, as it could help to reduce the number of people who are addicted to gambling. Gambling addiction is a serious issue, and can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones.

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, roughly two percent of Americans are addicted to gambling. This addiction can lead to financial problems, relationship issues, and even suicide.

Apple and Google’s decision to ban gambling apps will not solve this problem overnight, but it is a step in the right direction. By removing these addictive apps from their stores, Apple and Google are helping people to break free from their addiction and get their lives back on track.

#  How to end your gambling addiction with CBT

Gambling addiction is a problem that many people face, and it can be hard to break the habit. If you are looking for a way to end your gambling addiction, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) may be the answer for you.

#  Why can’t I stop gambling? The science of addiction

In the United States, gambling is only legal in a limited number of states, and it is strictly regulated. The reason for this is because gambling can be addictive. Many people enjoy gambling and can do it without any negative consequences, but for others, gambling can be very destructive.

Gambling addiction is a real thing, and scientists are beginning to understand why some people become addicted to it while others don’t. Here are some of the things that are believed to contribute to gambling addiction:

* Genetics: Some people may be more predisposed to developing a gambling addiction than others due to their genetics.

* Environment: The environment in which a person grows up can also play a role in their likelihood of developing a gambling addiction. If someone’s family members or friends gamble, that person may be more likely to develop an addiction.

* Brain chemistry: Gambling releases dopamine in the brain, which is a chemical that causes pleasure. For people who are susceptible to addiction, this can be dangerous because it can lead them to keep gambling in order to get that dopamine rush.

* Personality traits: Certain personality traits may also make someone more likely to develop a gambling addiction. These include impulsiveness and risk-taking behavior.

Addiction is a complex problem that involves many different factors. However, scientists are beginning to understand the underlying causes of addiction and how it can be treated. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help from a qualified professional.
