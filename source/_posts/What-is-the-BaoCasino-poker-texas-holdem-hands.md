# What is the BaoCasino poker texas holdem hands?

The Bao Casino Hold'em poker is a variation of the poker game where players are dealt two cards face down and five cards face up. The face-up cards are communal, and bets are placed on the best five-card hand among all players. A player can either play the two cards they were dealt or trade them in for the three displayed communal cards.



# How to play

Bets are placed before any cards are revealed. To bet, players must put in chips equal to the big blind or fold. The big blind is typically half the minimum bet. After all betting is complete, each player is dealt two cards face down, which are not shown to any other player. The dealer then flips three cards face up on the table. These are communal cards that can be used by any player to make their best five-card hand. Players now have two choices: they can either keep the two cards they were originally dealt, or they can trade them in for the three communal cards.



If a player chooses to trade in their two original cards for the three communal cards, their hand will consist of four communal cards and only one original card. If a player keeps their two original cards, their hand will consist of five original cards. After all players have made their choice, the highest ranking hand among all players will win the pot. If there is a tie, the pot is split evenly among all players with the highest ranking hands.
