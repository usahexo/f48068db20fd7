#  Ready, Set, Hold'em: Grand Island Casino to Start Offering Poker Later This Year

The grand opening of the new Grand Island Casino is slated for later this year, and with it will come a brand new poker room!

Poker players in the region have long awaited this day, as the only other option for playing the game is at one of the state's larger casinos located several hours away.

While the specific date has yet to be announced, officials promise that the new casino will be up and running by summer.

In preparation for the poker room's launch, the casino is currently hiring dealers and other staff members who will be responsible for running the games.

As far as what can be expected from the poker room, officials are keeping tight-lipped. However, they promise that it will be one of the largest in the state, with an extensive range of games and tournaments available.

This is great news for local poker players, who have been lobbying for a venue like this for years. In addition to giving them a place to play closer to home, it will also create new jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the area.
