#  Where Was the Typewriter Invented?

The typewriter was invented by a man named Christopher Latham Sholes in the year 1868. However, it would not be until several years later that the typewriter would be mass produced and sold to the public.

Up until the invention of the typewriter, the only way to produce text was to use a pen and paper. This process could be very time consuming and tedious, which is why many people were excited when the typewriter was first introduced.

The typewriter quickly became popular and soon replaced the pen and paper as the primary way to produce text. This was largely due to the fact that the typewriter could produce text much faster than using a pen and paper.

Over time, the typewriter has evolved and changed somewhat, but it still remains an important part of our society. In fact, many people still use typewriters today, even though they are no longer as popular as they once were.

So, where was the typewriter invented? The answer is Christopher Latham Sholes in 1868. Thanks for reading!

#  Hemingway's First Typewriter

Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899 and, by the time he was 21, he had already been published in The Chicago Daily News. He had also served in World War I as an ambulance driver. But it was his first novel, The Sun Also Rises, that would make him a literary star.

Hemingway is credited with popularizing the "stream of consciousness" writing style, and he is considered one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.

Hemingway's life was filled with adventure and he was known for his hard-living lifestyle. In 1959, at the age of 61, he committed suicide.

But Hemingway was not just a great writer; he was also an accomplished sportsman. He enjoyed fishing, hunting and boxing. And like many great authors, Hemingway also had a passion for typewriters.

In fact, Hemingway owned more than 60 typewriters during his lifetime. And his love for typewriters began early on - in high school, Hemingway bought his first typewriter for $15.

That typewriter was a Royal 10 that Hemingway used to write letters to his parents and girlfriends. And it was also the typewriter that he used to write The Sun Also Rises.

Although Hemingway later became known for using vintage manual typewriters, including models from Remington and Olympia, his first love was always the Royal 10. In fact, when Royal quit making the 10 in 1936, Hemingway wrote them a letter asking them to start production again!

Sadly, Royal never responded to Hemingway's letter and production of the Royal 10 ceased forever. But thanks to a few lucky collectors, a few examples of Hemingway's original Royal 10 still exist today.
