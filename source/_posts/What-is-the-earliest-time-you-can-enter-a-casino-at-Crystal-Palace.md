#  What is the earliest time you can enter a casino at Crystal Palace?

The earliest time you can enter a casino at Crystal Palace is 10am.

#  How close to the opening time can you arrive and still be allowed in?

Most clubs and music venues have a curfew, which means that the doors close at a certain time. usually, if you are not inside the venue by the time the doors close, then you will not be allowed in. this can be frustrating if you are running late or getting stuck in traffic, but there is usually still some hope.

generally speaking, most clubs will allow people to arrive up to 30 minutes after the door time. this gives you a little bit of wiggle room if something comes up and you are running late. however, it is important to keep in mind that each club is different and the curfew time may be earlier than 30 minutes.

if you know that you will be running late, it is always best to give the club a call ahead of time and let them know. this way, they can plan for your arrival and make sure that you are able to get in.
