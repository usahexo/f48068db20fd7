#  What are Toronto Blue Jays? 

The Toronto Blue Jays are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Blue Jays compete in the Eastern Division of the American League (AL). The team was founded in 1977 as an expansion team. The Blue Jays have won two World Series championships (1992 and 1993).

The Blue Jays play their home games at Rogers Centre. The franchise is valued at US$1.3 billion, making them the second most valuable team in MLB. 

In 1973, the Canadian National Exhibition board of directors chose Toronto to host a new MLB franchise. Chicago White Sox executive Paul Johnson was appointed to head the effort to bring baseball to Toronto. He assembled a ownership group that included local businessmen John Labatt, Jr., Bill Mahoney, and Jack Kent Cooke. 

In November 1976, the MLB owners voted to expand by two teams for the 1977 season, with one of the teams being allocated to Toronto. The other team went to Seattle. In order for the team to be called "Blue Jays", Labatt initially offered $500,000 for the rights but wound up paying $1 million when Mahoney upped his stake in the club. 

On May 15, 1977, the Blue Jays played their first game against the Detroit Tigers at Tiger Stadium. They lost 9-5 but ace pitcher Dave Stieb would notch win #1 later that year on September 24th defeating the Yankees 5-3 at Exhibition Stadium (the old Skydome). The Blue Jays would finish their inaugural season 80-82, 3rd in their division and 14 games back of eventual World Series Champion Baltimore Orioles. 

Since then they have been one of the better Canadian franchises in all four major sports leagues (NHL Maple Leafs, CFL Argonauts=Toronto proper NFL Bills & MLS Toronto FC=Greater Toronto Area outside of downtown). 1990 saw their first playoff berth infused with some amazing players such as Roberto Alomar & Joe Carter which led to back-to-back World Series Championships culminating in a dramatic game 6 win over Philadelphia Phillies in 1993; cementing themselves into legend as one of if not THE best moments in Canadian sports history! From there it's had plenty of other exciting seasons including consecutive AL East titles 2004 & 2005 and reaching their 3rd World Series title BUT losing Game 7 vs Kansas City Royals in 2015 leaving fans still begging for another Championship parade down Bay Street!
