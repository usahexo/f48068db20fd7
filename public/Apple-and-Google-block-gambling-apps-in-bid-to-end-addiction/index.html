<p>This move is in line with the companies’ previous efforts to remove addictive apps from their stores. In January, Apple announced that it would be removing all time-wasting apps from its store, and in March, Google announced that it would be banning all apps that encourage excessive use.</p>
<p>While gambling apps are not as widely used as other types of addictive apps, they can be just as dangerous. According to a study conducted by the University of British Columbia, gambling apps can be up to six times more addictive than other types of apps.</p>
<p>This move is likely to be welcomed by many, as it could help to reduce the number of people who are addicted to gambling. Gambling addiction is a serious issue, and can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones.</p>
<p>According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, roughly two percent of Americans are addicted to gambling. This addiction can lead to financial problems, relationship issues, and even suicide.</p>
<p>Apple and Google’s decision to ban gambling apps will not solve this problem overnight, but it is a step in the right direction. By removing these addictive apps from their stores, Apple and Google are helping people to break free from their addiction and get their lives back on track.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-Six-tips-to-help-you-beat-it"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-Six-tips-to-help-you-beat-it" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction: Six tips to help you beat it"></a>Gambling addiction: Six tips to help you beat it</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem.

<ol>
<li><p>Seek professional help. There are therapies and programs specifically designed to help people overcome gambling addictions. Don’t try to go it alone – get professional help.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Set boundaries. Don’t let gambling become an all-consuming activity.Decide how much money you’re willing to spend on gambling each week or month, and stick to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take breaks from gambling. If you’re starting to feel like gambling is taking over your life, take a break from it – even if it means skipping a night at the casino or not logging in to your online account for a while.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find healthy hobbies and activities. When you’re not gambling, fill your time with positive activities that make you happy and help improve your life. This could be anything from spending time outdoors in nature to volunteering for a charity close to your heart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay positive and motivated. Gambling addiction can be a difficult thing to overcome, but remember that you’re not alone in this fight. Stay positive and motivated, and keep reminding yourself why you want to beat this addiction.”</p>

<h1 id="How-to-end-your-gambling-addiction-with-CBT"><a href="#How-to-end-your-gambling-addiction-with-CBT" class="headerlink" title="How to end your gambling addiction with CBT"></a>How to end your gambling addiction with CBT</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a problem that many people face, and it can be hard to break the habit. If you are looking for a way to end your gambling addiction, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) may be the answer for you.</p>
<p>CBT is a type of therapy that helps you to change the way you think and behave. It can be effective in helping people to overcome a range of problems, including gambling addiction.</p>
<p>If you are interested in trying CBT to overcome your gambling addiction, here are some tips on how to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to your doctor about CBT.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your doctor will be able to refer you to a therapist who can provide CBT treatment for gambling addiction.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find a therapist who specialises in CBT for gambling addiction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all therapists offer CBT for gambling addiction, so it is important to find one who does. You can find a list of therapists who offer CBT for gambling addiction on the website of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make a commitment to attend therapy sessions.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the key things that makes CBT successful is consistency. It is important to attend all of your therapy sessions so that you can get the most out of the treatment.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Be open and honest with your therapist.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important thing when undergoing CBT is honesty. You need to be open and honest with your therapist about your thoughts and feelings, both past and present. This will help them to help you in the best possible way.</p>
<h1 id="Why-can’t-I-stop-gambling-The-science-of-addiction"><a href="#Why-can’t-I-stop-gambling-The-science-of-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Why can’t I stop gambling? The science of addiction"></a>Why can’t I stop gambling? The science of addiction</h1><p>In the United States, gambling is only legal in a limited number of states, and it is strictly regulated. The reason for this is because gambling can be addictive. Many people enjoy gambling and can do it without any negative consequences, but for others, gambling can be very destructive.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a real thing, and scientists are beginning to understand why some people become addicted to it while others don’t. Here are some of the things that are believed to contribute to gambling addiction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Genetics: Some people may be more predisposed to developing a gambling addiction than others due to their genetics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Environment: The environment in which a person grows up can also play a role in their likelihood of developing a gambling addiction. If someone’s family members or friends gamble, that person may be more likely to develop an addiction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Brain chemistry: Gambling releases dopamine in the brain, which is a chemical that causes pleasure. For people who are susceptible to addiction, this can be dangerous because it can lead them to keep gambling in order to get that dopamine rush.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Personality traits: Certain personality traits may also make someone more likely to develop a gambling addiction. These include impulsiveness and risk-taking behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Addiction is a complex problem that involves many different factors. However, scientists are beginning to understand the underlying causes of addiction and how it can be treated. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help from a qualified professional.</p>

But it is possible with the right advice and support. Here, we spoke to people who have overcome their gambling addictions to find out how they did it.</p>
<p>Here are their top tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seek professional help</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re struggling to overcome your gambling addiction, it’s important to seek professional help. There are many organisations and support groups specifically for gambling addiction, and they can provide you with the support and guidance you need to break free from your addiction.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Make a plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Breaking any habit can be challenging, but it’s important to have a plan in place to make the process as smooth as possible. When it comes to overcoming a gambling addiction, your plan should include things like healthy coping mechanisms, quitting cold turkey or gradually reducing your bets, and ways to deal with temptation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stay positive</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be easy to get down on yourself when trying to overcome an addiction, but it’s important to stay positive and keep your goal in mind. Remind yourself why you want to break free from your addiction and focus on the benefits of a healthy and addiction-free life.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Avoid temptation</li>
</ol>
<p>When breaking any habit, avoiding temptation is key. This means steering clear of places where you usually gamble, removing all forms of gambling from your home or office, and staying away from people who encourage your addiction.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Take care of yourself</li>
</ol>
<p>Addictions can take a toll on both body and mind, so it’s important to take care of yourself when breaking free from one. Make sure you get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet, and participate in activities that make you happy and relaxed.</p>
