According to casino officials, there was over $1.5 million in winnings at the tables during the month. This is a significant increase from the $982,000 that was won in March 2017.</p>
<p>This is great news for the casino resort, which has been seeing increasing visitation numbers in recent years. In fact, the Twin Arrows Casino Resort saw its highest visitation numbers ever in 2017, with over 1.3 million guests. This can be attributed to several factors, including the casino’s increasing number of gaming options and its location near some of the most popular tourist destinations in Arizona.</p>
<p>The Twin Arrows Casino Resort is also one of the few casinos in Arizona that offer Texas hold’em as well as other table games such as blackjack and craps. This has helped it to become a popular destination for poker players from all over the country.</p>
<p>In addition to its table games, the Twin Arrows Casino Resort also offers slots and video poker machines, as well as a variety of restaurants and bars.

<h1 id="Twin-Arrows-Casino-Resort-posts-biggest-Texas-hold’em-win-ever-in-February"><a href="#Twin-Arrows-Casino-Resort-posts-biggest-Texas-hold’em-win-ever-in-February" class="headerlink" title="Twin Arrows Casino Resort posts biggest Texas hold’em win ever in February!"></a>Twin Arrows Casino Resort posts biggest Texas hold’em win ever in February!</h1><p>The Twin Arrows Casino Resort in Flagstaff, Arizona has announced that one of its players pulled off an amazing Texas hold’em win in February, earning a staggering $259,460! According to the casino, it is the biggest cash prize ever awarded in one of its Texas hold’em tournaments.</p>
<p>The lucky winner, who has chosen to remain anonymous, walked away with the top prize after battling through a field of more than 100 players. The tournament was part of the casino’s regular schedule and lasted for two days.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Twin Arrows Casino Resort spokesperson Heide Brandes, she said “We are absolutely thrilled with this impressive win. It just goes to show that our players never give up and always come out on top.”</p>
<p>Texas hold’em is one of the most popular variants of poker and is often played in tournaments. The game involves each player being dealt two cards (private cards) and then betting on whether they will be able to make a better hand using any five community cards that are placed face-up in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>The Twin Arrows Casino Resort is located on the Navajo Nation near Flagstaff and is owned and operated by the Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise. It offers a range of gaming options including blackjack, craps, roulette, and slots as well as several types of poker including Texas hold’em.</p>

<p>What is it about Twin Arrows Casino Resort that makes it so popular for Texas hold’em players? Part of it may have to do with the variety of games and tournaments offered.
